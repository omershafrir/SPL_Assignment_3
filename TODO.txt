TO VERIFY:

1. connectionsImpl : boolean send ? what boolean means.
2. encdecimpl does not use methods bytesToShort() & shortToBytes at all. okay?
3. when catching
4. ';' symbol in the end of every message?


TO REMEMBER:
1. call disconnect(int connectionId) when calling logout()/
2. TODO: fix decoding of ACKMessage & ERRORMessage when given argument messageOpcode is 2 digits.
3. for erez : continue routine - BIDI & connections !!
4. POSTMessage process: vector of users that need to get the message , proccessing the message and put the users in the vector
5. PMMessage process: filter the words
6. implement isBlocked
7. check ACKS for everyone!!!
8. take care for notification after sending the messages
9. blocking
10. how does connectionIDS updates ?   //// EXTRA IMPORTANT
11. on block - both of the users stop follow each other - is it enough? should we do more?
