TO VERIFY:
1. who gets notification
2. when does the notification get to the user if he is offline
3. should terminate V (?)
4. concurrency - done - need to be checked
5. checkout about stats - i think that this is finished - should check this together

TO REMEMBER:
1. deal with notification
2. should terminate








1. connectionsImpl : boolean send ? what boolean means.
2. encdecimpl does not use methods bytesToShort() & shortToBytes at all. okay?
3. when catching
4. ';' symbol in the end of every message?



1. call disconnect(int connectionId) when calling logout()/
2. fix decoding of ACKMessage & ERRORMessage when given argument messageOpcode is 2 digits. V
3. for erez : continue routine - BIDI & connections !!
4. POSTMessage process: vector of users that need to get the message , proccessing the message and put the users in the vector
5. PMMessage process: filter the words
6. implement isBlocked                 V
7. check ACKS for everyone!!!          V
8. take care for notification after sending the messages      V
9. blocking                            V
10. how does connectionIDS updates ?   //// EXTRA IMPORTANT
11. on block - both of the users stop follow each other - is it enough? should we do more?    V
